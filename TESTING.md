## Automated Testing


### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Users | tests.py | 99% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test/users.png) |
| Reservations | tests.py | 89% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test/reservations.png) |
| Website | tests.py | 97% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test/website.png) |
